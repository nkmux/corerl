STATE SPACE RECOMMENDATION FOR RL:
-----------------------------------
Based on analysis, the RL state space should include:
- Indoor temperature (°C)
- Indoor humidity (%)
- Outdoor temperature (°C)
- Solar radiation (W/m²)
- Occupancy count
- Hour of day (0-23)
- Day type (0=weekday, 1=weekend)

SAUDI-SPECIFIC RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION:
------------------------------------
This analysis establishes the first comprehensive MPC benchmark for building
energy control across Saudi Arabia's diverse climate conditions using official
electricity tariffs. The benchmark provides fair comparison criteria for 
evaluating RL approaches in the Saudi context.

Total Analysis Coverage: {len(results_summary)} building-weather combinations
Simulation Hours: {sum(data['annual'].get('number_of_seasons', 0) * 24 * 14 for data in results_summary.values())} hours
Currency: Saudi Riyal (SAR) with USD equivalents
Pricing Structure: Saudi Electricity Regulatory Authority Official Tariffs
Climate Coverage: Mountain (Abha), Coastal (Jeddah), Desert (Riyadh)
Benchmark Status: ESTABLISHED ✓

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Use this benchmark to train and evaluate RL models for Saudi buildings
2. Implement fair comparison protocols using SAR-based costs
3. Document RL performance against Saudi MPC baseline
4. Publish results comparing model-based vs learning-based control in Saudi context
5. Consider hybrid MPC-RL approaches for Saudi building automation
6. Extend to other Saudi cities and building types
7. Integrate with Saudi Vision 2030 energy efficiency goals

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
--------------------
- Supports Saudi Vision 2030 energy efficiency targets
- Provides baseline for building energy performance standards
- Enables evidence-based electricity tariff optimization
- Supports smart city development initiatives
- Contributes to NEOM and other mega-project energy planning
