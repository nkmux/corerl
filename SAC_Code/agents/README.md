# Add your agent here


Your agent needs to be a subclass of the Citylearn environment's Agent class. 
Specifically, it should implement the `predict` function that takes in a list of observations and returns the actions. 
Additionally for AIcrowd evlauations you need to implement the `register_reset` function that will be called for 
the first set of observations only, this will help you do additional processing in the start of the episode if you want.


# Refer to the rule based agent (`rbc_agent.py`) example and create your agents in the same format
